Inherits [Transform](../transform/transform.md)

A [Transform](../transform/transform.md) that can change state at project time.

See:

* [Members](members.md)
* [Constructors](constructors.md)
* [Functions](functions.md)

TimeVaryingTransforms are [Transforms](../transform/transform.md) that need to change their state at project time. This is opposed to [Transforms](../transform/transform.md) which can only change state at train time. Common examples include video processing across multiple frames, aggregate projection statistics etc.
